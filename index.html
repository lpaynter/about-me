        <p>I <strong>love</strong> puzzles and working them from start to finish. Seeing a completed project that has come together based on everyone’s input and solves a business problem is very satisfying to me.

            I am both an analytical thinker and a creative. I’ve always been comfortable taking complex information and shaping it in a way that is easy to consume.
            
            My <em>ideal client </em>is a cooperative or small business. Working for the people or helping a business grow appeals to me because I want to make an impact. Visit <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lisapaynter/" target="_blank">my Linkedin</a>
